# LAB 3 - FPGA AND DETECTION

In this lab, you will split into two teams to develop an FPGA module  
capable of detecting basic shapes. This device will be mounted on the  
robot and be used to identify these shapes on the walls of the maze.

Below is a block diagram of the device that will implemented.
