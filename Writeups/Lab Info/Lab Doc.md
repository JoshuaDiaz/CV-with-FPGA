# LAB 3 - FPGA and Shape Detection

In this lab, you will split into two teams to develop an FPGA module capable of detecting basic shapes. This device will be mounted on the robot to identify these shapes on the walls of the maze.

Below is a block diagram of the device that will implemented.

In order to setup the digital camera needed, you will need to familiarize yourselves with with 



Your group will need to split into two subteams. One team will be responsible for setting up the OV7670 Camera
