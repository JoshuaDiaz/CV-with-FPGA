## FPGA + CV

Part of the project to revamp the course ECE 3400: Intelligent Physical Systems at Cornell University during the Summer of 2018. 

Goal:
Using an inexpensive camera interfaced with an FPGA to detect basic colors and shapes.
The device will be mounted on an arduino based robot, to which it will send signals signifying what color and shape it sees, if any.

Hardware Used:
OV7670 Without FIFO
DE0-Nano (non -SOC)
Arduino UNO
