# FPGA + CV

Part of the project to revamp the course ECE 3400: Intelligent Physical Systems at Cornell University during the Summer of 2018. <br />

Goal:<br />
Using an inexpensive camera interfaced with an FPGA to detect basic colors and shapes.<br />
The device will be mounted on an arduino based robot, to which it will send signals signifying what color and shape it sees, if any.<br />

Hardware Used:<br />
OV7670 Without FIFO<br />
DE0-Nano (non -SOC)<br />
Arduino UNO<br />
